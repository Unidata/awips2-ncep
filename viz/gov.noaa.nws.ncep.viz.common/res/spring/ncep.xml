  <!-- Task 1051 : G. Hull 
       Trigger start-up code for the NCP regardless of which perspective is activated first.	
       This is used to force the Desk Level to get created and registered so that the 
       Localization perspective will recognize desk-level files even if the NCP hasn't been activated.
